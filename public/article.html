      <p>Our school is the last hope in this city for teenagers who want to get a diploma and find their way out of poverty and abuse.</p>
      
      <p>My 6-year-old Ojibwe daughter turned to me and said, “Mommy, that’s not okay. We’re people, not mascots.” And she&#39;s right.</p>
      
      <p>A year after my last date, my world probably looks the same from the outside. What’s different is how I’m now experiencing my life.</p>

      <p>Growing up fat and trans, photographer Shoog McDaniel was constantly bullied. But when they found a batch of disposable cameras in their late teens, they found their calling.

      <p>My life could&#39;ve been different if I had the resources to understand my experience.</p>
