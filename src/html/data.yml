P:
- "They're not friendly enough. There have been far too many times I've walked through the foyer of a church and NOT been greeted or said hello to or helped. First impressions matter."
- "Christianity could well use a revival in these days of worldwide apostasy and no one would discourage the move of God's Spirit, but it is far more likely that the church may be concentrated rather than expanded in the next few years."
- "I'll be honest with you: I can be quick to say, \"That person needs Jesus.\" Truthfully, I need Jesus just as much (if not more sometimes) than when I make unhealthy comments like that. Recently, I've come to realize that instead of constantly praying for revival \"in other people\" I need to first be praying for revival within myself."
- "What explains Billy Graham's humility and integrity? Here was his greatest fear ..."
- "I firmly believe there is a trend being established in the Western world. It's subtle in nature but if you are carefully watching what is going on, you will discern that the tide of public opinion is rapidly turning against true Bible-believing Christians. It is time for followers of Jesus to get ready for persecution in the West."
- "We all know Abraham—an imperfect man, but one of unfathomable faith as he obediently put his son Isaac on the altar in Genesis 22."
- "As children, we are \"members of the household of God\" who \"ought to behave in the household of God\" as He prescribes."
- "We all inherently feel our work should have meaning beyond earning a living — be about something bigger than ourselves. We want a sense that even the tedium in our jobs serves a purpose."
- "Everyone who has been through elementary school has been asked the basic question, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" When we ask that question, we are teaching children that your job is an important part of your identity. But how much help do we really give kids in figuring out why vocation is important?"
- "The missionary [is] often caricatured as standing under a palm tree, wearing a pith helmet and declaiming the gospel to a group of ill-clad \"natives\" sitting respectfully around him on the ground."
- "Tucked away within the former abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in the upscale Parisian neighborhood of the same name is an elaborate monument that is obviously regal in nature."
- "For the past two years, I have been monitoring the comments and challenges mentioned by church leaders. I am attempting to answer the question: What is hindering many of our churches from achieving health and vitality?"
- "The famed astrophysicist, who struggled for most of his life with ALS, left the shackles of his withered body on March 14th, his soul launched into a Christ-less eternity. He had a huge impact as a theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author. While he made references to God, he remained a staunch atheist to the end."
- "It is right and good for children to grow up, individuate, and live independently, semi-autonomous from their parents. But when taken to post-modern extremes, autonomy produces individuals who have come to believe that the world literally revolves around them."
- "Stephen Hawking didn't stay in his lane. He was a scientist, but in each of his books and nearly all of his media appearances, he ventured into philosophy, masking metaphysical observations and proclamations in language of scientific certainty."
- "Like most leaders, Senator Roger Wicker is astounded that the Navy is even considering letting someone who doesn't believe in God join the chaplaincy. Three years ago, the idea was so absurd that even Obama's military attorneys went to court to stop it."
- "Freedom is a very spiritual thing. It's a part of our being made in the glorious image of our Maker. Nevertheless, with the gift of liberty there also comes danger."
- "This issue is personal to both of us. We write, respectively, as the president of The Christian and Missionary Alliance, an evangelical denomination headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and a Dreamer whose church, The Crossing Church, is part of the denomination."
- "Should pregnancy care centers be forced to advertise abortions? A California law was squarely aimed at only one kind of facility: pro-life pregnancy centers. California's attempt to muzzle a message it disagrees with couldn't be plainer."
- "People are fleeing the institutional church and there should be no question as to why this exodus is happening."
- "Today, March 21, 2018, is \"World Down Syndrome Day\" where the international community recognizes and expresses appreciation for the millions of our fellow human beings who have Down syndrome."
- "I will never get tired of telling you about the latest archaeological find that unearths living proof of the Bible's history."
- "Castigating the kids of Parkland, including the hundreds and thousands of others who identify closely with them and are as vulnerable to gun violence as they are—and in many cases even more so—is to do the diametric opposite of what Jesus did on the day he called the children to himself."
- "Jim Carrey's now viral caricatures of the White House Press Secretary and then the President are seen by some as political satire and by others as sacrilege."
- "The young man felt conflicted. Filling in as the leader of a monthly prayer session, he wondered how bold to be when asking God specifically for healing."
